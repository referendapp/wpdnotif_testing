This addon adds a nice notification system to your site, so users can receive
updates and notifications directly on your website as they happen. It checks 
and notifies when someone votes on your comment, follows you, rates your post, 
mentions you, replies to your comment, comments on your post, when your comment 
is approved and in other cases. You can put the notification bell in the main 
menu using %wpdiscuz-bell% shortocde as a Custom Link URL and any phrase as the 
Link Text. This menu item will be replaced to a notification bell on the website 
front-end menu. As a second option, you can enable Web Push Notification 
generated and controlled by browsers. This kind of notifications are displayed 
on the screen even if you switched to another tab or minimized the browser window.
